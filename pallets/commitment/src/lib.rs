//! 
//! Implementation crate for the [`Commitment`](frame_suite::commitment)
//! family of traits.
//!
//! A semantic bonding layer that binds assets to caller-defined purpose and context,
//! with collective management of bonded value and lazy adjustments.
//!
//! Used instead of direct fungible locks to enable richer control semantics and
//! automated balance management. These are called commitments as they inherently
//! carry a semantic reason defined by the consuming pallet.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! - [`Config`] - Runtime configuration
//! - [`Call`] - Dispatchable extrinsics
//! - [`Pallet`] - Trait implementation for external modules
//!
//! This pallet provides a **generalized bonding (locking) mechanism** for
//! fungible (quantitative) assets, enabling other pallets to express
//! **structured financial intent**.
//!
//! Instead of treating balances as passive values, this system allows assets to be:
//!
//! - **Bonded under a reason** (e.g., `LockReason`)
//! - **Bound to a digest** (a context-specific identifier defined by the caller pallet)
//!
//! Together, this forms a **Commitment**:
//!
//! ```text
//! Commitment = bond(asset) -> (reason, digest)
//! ```
//!
//! ## Key Responsibilities
//!
//! This pallet acts as a **shared infrastructure layer** that:
//!
//! - Locks assets on behalf of any fungible account
//! - Groups commitments under **runtime-defined reasons**
//! - Tracks and manages value at the **digest level**
//! - Allows controlled updates to aggregated digest values
//!
//! The **meaning and context of each digest** are defined by the
//! caller pallet (e.g., staking, escrow, trading, governance).
//!
//! ## Core Features
//!
//! - **Commitment** - lock assets under `(reason, digest)`, enforcing one commitment per
//!   (proprietor, reason). Value can only increase per commitment, while aggregate
//!   digest values may be adjusted. Supports lazy resolution.
//!
//! - **Digest Management** - track and update aggregate value at the digest level,
//!   propagating changes to all commitments.
//!
//! - **Digest Mint / Reap** - increase or decrease the aggregate value of a digest,
//!   automatically adjusting all associated commitments proportionally.
//!
//! - **Indexes** - group multiple digests with share-based ownership
//!   (see [`CommitIndex`](frame_suite::commitment::CommitIndex)).
//!
//! - **Pools** - manager-controlled allocation with dynamic rebalancing and fixed
//!   commissions (see [`CommitPool`](frame_suite::commitment::CommitPool)).
//!
//! - **Variants** - semantic differentiation (e.g., long/short, positive/negative)
//!   (see [`CommitVariant`](frame_suite::commitment::CommitVariant)).
//!
//! - **Lazy Evaluation** - values reflect live digest state and are realized on query
//!   or resolution.
//!
//! - **Asset Agnostic** - works with any fungible asset type implementing required traits.
//!
//! Each commitment is scoped by a **Reason** and anchored to a **Digest**.
//!
//! ### Design Scope
//!
//! The pallet is a **generic implementation** of
//! [`Commitment`](frame_suite::commitment::Commitment),
//! designed to be **loosely coupled** with consumer pallets via their `Config` traits.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // Consumer pallet configuration
//! pub trait Config {
//!     /// Commitment adapter providing bonding logic
//!     type CommitmentAdapter: Commitment<Self::AccountId>;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! It handles commitment accounting and lifecycle management, while consumer
//! pallets define domain-specific logic and user interactions.
//!
//! This provides a **bonding abstraction over basic fungible locks**, enabling
//! rich economic behaviors without duplicating core logic.
//!
//! ## Extrinsics Scope
//!
//! This pallet exposes **no user-facing extrinsics for commitments**.
//!
//! Commitment operations are accessed by consumer pallets through the traits,
//! ensuring controlled and domain-specific usage.
//!
//! Only minimal extrinsics for **basic deposit and withdrawal** for a
//! default `PrepareForCommit` hold/reserve are provided and some read-only
//! APIs (see [`Call`]).
//!
//! ## Native Commitment Reserve
//!
//! This pallet exposes only minimal extrinsics to deposit and withdraw
//! funds into a native reserve ([`HoldReason::PrepareForCommit`]), which acts
//! as the default funding source for all commitment operations.
//!
//! Commitments consume assets from this reserve under
//! [`Fortitude::Polite`](frame_support::traits::tokens::Fortitude),
//! allowing users to pre-fund commitments once and reuse the
//! same reserve across all consumer pallets, ensuring efficient,
//! directive-driven execution
//!
//! When [`Fortitude::Force`](frame_support::traits::tokens::Fortitude)
//! is used, operations may fallback to the liquid (free) balance if
//! reserve funds are insufficient.
//!
//! Consumer pallets utilizing commitments should account for this behavior:
//! - use polite semantics to operate strictly on reserved funds
//! - use force semantics to allow fallback to liquid balance when required
//!
//! ## Instance and Model
//!
//! The pallet supports **multiple instances**, each capable of handling
//! commitments across diverse scenarios.
//!
//! - Each instance may define its own configuration via [`Config`],
//!   allowing independent behavior and specialization.
//!
//! - Each instance supports **multiple reasons**, enabling different pallets
//!   or domains to operate within the same instance.
//!
//! - A single instance can be shared across multiple consumer pallets,
//!   with separation maintained through reasons and digests.
//!
//! - Instances may be separated when isolation is required.
//!
//! This enables the pallet to act as a **shared economic layer** across use cases.
//!
//! ## Terminology
//!
//! - **Proprietor** - the account or entity that owns and manages commitments.
//! - **Reason** - the categorical purpose of a commitment.
//! - **Digest** - a unique identifier representing commitment context.
//! - **Direct Commitment** - a commitment to a single digest.
//! - **Index** - a collection of digests with shares
//!   (see [`CommitIndex`](frame_suite::commitment::CommitIndex)).
//! - **Pool** - a managed structure with allocation and commission
//!   (see [`CommitPool`](frame_suite::commitment::CommitPool)).
//! - **Entry** - a digest component within an index.
//! - **Slot** - a digest component within a pool.
//! - **Commission** - manager's share collected on resolution.
//! - **Variant** - semantic position (see
//!   [`CommitVariant`](frame_suite::commitment::CommitVariant)).
//!
//! ## Development Feature Gate
//!
//! This pallet includes a `dev` feature gate for development and testing.
//!
//! Core functionality is exposed via public APIs for RPC and UI usage.
//! The `dev` feature provides thin wrapper extrinsics and extended
//! events for direct inspection.
//!
//! This feature must be disabled in production runtimes due to additional debugging overhead.
