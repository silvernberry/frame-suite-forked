// ===============================================================================

//! Implementation module of the [`Commitment Family`](frame_suite::commitment)
//! traits, where we utilize indexes, pools, and variants to create a flexible and
//! semantic commitment system.
//!
//! Low-level helper traits are defined in [`crate::traits`] within this crate. These
//! helpers provide fundamental functions that can be reused by other implementations
//! to offer a similar commitment system.
//!
//! The asset type is defined as the fungible trait's balance - i.e., a unit with
//! fungible behaviours. See the required trait bounds of [`Config::Asset`] to
//! understand which methods this system utilizes.
//!
//! Notably, this commitment system does not rely on standard balanced (safe) fungible methods.
//! Instead, it uses its own safe models via low-level methods provided by fungible traits.
//! Therefore, it does not query the total asset in circulation, as its scope is limited
//! to commitments for the particular asset holder.
//!
//! [`Pallet`] implements:
//! - [`InspectAsset`]
//! - [`DigestModel`]
//! - [`Commitment`]
//! - [`CommitIndex`]
//! - [`CommitPool`]
//! - [`CommitVariant`]
//! - [`IndexVariant`]
//! - [`PoolVariant`]
//! - and other helper traits include
//!     - [`CommitErrorHandler`]
//!
//! Local Tests for these traits are covered in `tests`.
