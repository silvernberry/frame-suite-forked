//! 
//! The **Authors pallet** implements a economically-backed **role system**
//! for managing **block authors* (validators) as first-class on-chain actors.
//!
//! This pallet provides a concrete, implementation of the
//! generic role abstractions, enabling authors to be enrolled, funded, elected,
//! rewarded, penalized, and governed in a deterministic and auditable manner.
//!
//! - [`Config`] - Runtime configuration
//! - [`Call`] - Dispatchable extrinsics
//! - [`Pallet`] - External Usage (Trait Impls)
//! - [`FlatElection`] - External Usage (Resolved Plugin)
//! - [`FairElection`]- External Usage (Resolved Plugin)
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! An **Author** represents an actor who:
//! - locks **self-collateral** as a security commitment (enrollment),
//! - progresses through a **probationary lifecycle** before permanence.
//! - may receive **external backing** from third parties (funding),
//! - participates in **elections** and other duties,
//! - accrues **rewards and penalties over time**, and
//!
//! The pallet models authors as **economic and temporal subjects**, not merely
//! accounts.
//!
//! ## Architectural Role
//!
//! The pallet provides a **composable role layer** that integrates:
//! - lifecycle management (enrollment, status, resignation),
//! - economic backing (collateral and external funding),
//! - reward and penalty scheduling,
//! - probation and risk handling,
//! - activity-aware participation controls.
//!
//! This allows the Authors pallet to act as a **pluggable role provider**
//! for other runtime modules without exposing low-level storage details.
//!
//! ## Funding Models
//!
//! Authors may receive economic support through multiple funding paths:
//!
//! - **Self-collateral** provided during enrollment.
//! - **Direct backing** from individual backers.
//! - **Aggregated backing** via indexes or pools (when enabled).
//!
//! All funding is mediated through a shared commitment abstraction, ensuring
//! consistent locking, accounting, and release semantics across the runtime.
//!
//! ## Election Models
//!
//! The pallet supports **pluggable election strategies** via
//! [`elections`](frame_suite::elections) traits, selectable at runtime-composition:
//!
//! - **Flat elections** aggregate all backing (including self-collateral)
//!   into a single influence metric per author.
//! - **Fair elections** preserve individual backer contributions and
//!   explicitly including self-collateral as a self-backing.
//!
//! Election logic is intentionally externalized using plugin-based models via [`Config`],
//! allowing governance to evolve influence and election logic without modifying pallet code.
//!
//! ## Temporal Semantics
//!
//! Rewards and penalties are:
//! - **scheduled**, not immediate,
//! - applied deterministically at block boundaries,
//! - buffered to prevent manipulation and race conditions.
//!
//! The pallet processes all pending compensations at the **start of each block**,
//! guaranteeing consistent state for subsequent extrinsics and elections.
//!
//! ## Governance & Safety
//!
//! Governance or Sudo may:
//! - adjust collateral and funding thresholds,
//! - tune probation and risk parameters,
//! - control election bounds and strictness,
//! - override configuration via root-only calls.
//!
//! Storage is intentionally **append-only** for critical mappings,
//! prioritizing auditability and long-term safety over aggressive cleanup.
//!
//! ## Intended Use
//!
//! While named "Authors", this pallet is designed to be reusable for any
//! economically-backed role such as:
//! - block producers,
//! - content curators,
//! - oracle operators,
//! - council members,
//! - or DAO representatives.
//!
//! It serves both as a reusable production pallet and as a reference
//! implementation of advanced role abstractions.
//!
//! ## Development Feature Gate
//!
//! This pallet includes a `dev` feature gate for development and testing.
//!
//! Core functionality is exposed via public APIs for RPC and UI usage.
//! The `dev` feature provides thin wrapper extrinsics and extended
//! events for direct inspection.
//!
//! This feature must be disabled in production runtimes due to additional debugging overhead.

    /// In this model, all sources of support associated with an author - including:
