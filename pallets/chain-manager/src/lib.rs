//! 
//! The **Chain Manager pallet** is the primary orchestration layer for
//! managing **session validators** as a coordinated, session-driven system.
//!
//! It governs the full validator lifecycle spanning participation,
//! election, activation, rewards, and penalties by materializing the
//! abstractions defined in [`frame_suite::blockchain`]
//! into a concrete runtime execution model.
//!
//! This pallet does not introduce new primitives. Instead, it binds together
//! traits, plugins, and adapters to drive deterministic validator selection
//! and behavior across sessions, enabling the game-theoretic guarantees
//! required for a decentralized network.
//!
//! - [`Config`] - Runtime configuration  
//! - [`Call`] - Dispatchable extrinsics (includes unsigned)  
//! - [`Pallet`] - External usage and trait implementations  
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! A **validator (author)** in this system is an actor who:
//!
//! - signals intent to participate in validation,
//! - submits affidavit data (backers) for election,
//! - competes in a session-based selection process,
//! - becomes an active session validator upon selection,
//! - receives rewards or penalties based on behavior.
//!
//! Validators are modeled as **session-scoped actors**, where
//! participation, selection, and compensation are tied to
//! deterministic session transitions.
//!
//! ## Architectural Role
//!
//! The pallet acts as an **orchestration boundary**, integrating:
//!
//! - role management and funding via [`Config::RoleAdapter`]  
//! - election logic via [`Config::ElectionAdapter`]  
//! - asset interactions via [`Config::Asset`]  
//! - session and authorship via [`pallet_session`] and [`pallet_authorship`]  
//! - offence handling via [`pallet_offences`]  
//!
//! It only tightly integrates with these essential core pallets, allowing
//! any Substrate runtime that composes them to adopt this pallet
//! for validator lifecycle and session management.
//!
//! ## Validator Lifecycle
//!
//! The system progresses through **session-scoped phases**:
//!
//! - **Pursuing Validation**  
//!   Authors signal intent to validate and may pause participation (`chill`).
//!
//! - **Affidavit Phase**  
//!   Active participants submit affidavit declarations representing
//!   election weights for the upcoming validator set.
//!
//! - **Election Phase**  
//!   Elections are executed for all active participants to determine
//!   the next session validators.
//!
//! - **Activation**  
//!   Elected authors transition into active session validators.
//!
//! - **Reward & Penalty**  
//!   Validators are compensated or penalized based on behavior.
//!
//! All transitions are derived relative to session progression,
//! ensuring predictable and deterministic execution.
//!
//! ## Execution Model
//!
//! The pallet operates as a **session-driven orchestration engine**,
//! primarily driven by **offchain workers and unsigned extrinsics**.
//!
//! Once validation intent is externally invoked by an author, the system
//! progresses automatically:
//!
//! - **Offchain workers**  
//!   coordinate affidavit submission, election execution, and key rotation  
//!
//! - **Unsigned extrinsics**  
//!   are submitted to finalize deterministic state transitions  
//!
//! - **Block hooks (`on_initialize`)**  
//!   process accumulated state and scheduled transitions  
//!
//! This enables:
//!
//! - automated validator lifecycle progression  
//! - continuous election participation for active candidates  
//! - minimal manual interaction beyond intent signaling  
//!
//! ## Economic Model
//!
//! Rewards and penalties are **externally defined and injected**:
//!
//! - [`Config::InflationModel`]: derives total session payout  
//! - [`Config::RewardModel`]: distributes rewards from points  
//! - [`Config::PenaltyModel`]: transforms and normalizes penalties  
//!
//! Final application is delegated via [`Config::RoleAdapter`],
//! ensuring consistent integration with role and funding systems.
//!
//! ## Design Intent
//!
//! This pallet is a **composition layer**, not a monolithic system:
//!
//! - structure is defined via traits  
//! - behavior is injected via plugins  
//! - coordination is driven by sessions and routines  
//!
//! enabling a modular, replaceable, and evolvable validator system
//! while preserving strong type safety and deterministic execution.
//!
//! ## Development Feature Gate
//!
//! This pallet includes a `dev` feature gate for development and testing.
//!
//! Core functionality is exposed via public APIs for RPC and UI usage.
//! The `dev` feature provides thin wrapper extrinsics and extended
//! event emissions for direct inspection.
//!
//! This feature must be disabled in production runtimes due to
//! additional debugging overhead.

        /// - **Best-effort execution**: no transactional rollback is assumed.
        /// - **Idempotent by design**: repeated execution across blocks or forks is safe.
        /// - **Authorization-aware**: each routine explicitly determines its authorized
        ///   signer via [`RoutineOf::who`] before execution.
        /// - **Fork-safe**: correctness is preserved across re-orgs through
        ///   fork-aware ([`frame_suite::ForkAware`]) and
        ///   finalized ([`frame_suite::Finalized`]) offchain
        ///   storage semantics.
